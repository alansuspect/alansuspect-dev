Is there a #flatfilecms I could point to my #eleventy dev folder that would act as a nice front end to manage the #markdown content?

I've looked at a few (such as #GravCMS, #tinacms, #picocms, #SpinalCMS) but they seem to do their own thing and manage files/site themselves, whereas I'd want Eleventy to handle everything and just have a nice UI instead of dealing with files.

The idea being when you save a post/page (.md file) it would update the e.g. GitHub repo and trigger the build. Any ideas?

Bonus points for being #opensource and also an accommodating free plan, or at least decent upgrade levels that don't go from free to $500 pm for an additional seat.

[Mattrbld](https://mattrbld.com) looks good but I'm not sure how mature/stable it is and so does #pagescms, if it can do what I'm after. I guess it also depends on hosting and my options there too.
